# Data Science Nanodegree second project (image classifier)

This is my implementation of an image classifier as per requirements of the second 
project in the Data Science Nanodegree. The project consists of two parts: a Jupyter 
Notebook, and a console application implemented as .py scripts.

## Usage

For the first part, you can examine the results of training a new classifier 
on the VGG-13 model by opening __Image Classifier Project.html__. You can 
run this code by opening __Image Classifier Project.ipynb__. 
The file is set up to be run using the run all cells command. 
In order to train a classifier based on a different model, change the variable `model_name`.

For the second part, you can check the functionality by running the following commands:

To see how to train the model, run `python train.py -h`

To see how to predict using a checkpoint, run `python predict.py -h`

### From Udacity: AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
